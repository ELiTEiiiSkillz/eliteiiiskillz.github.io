Not working
- Free Store / Free In-App Purchases! -> Buy in-game Loot Boxes for free! This is automatically active. This feature seems to get patched by the developer most of the time. So if it isn't working for you then it's patched.

- Zombie's Don't Attack -> It's a bit buggy. I think it works best if you enable it, then close the game while feature is on & reopen the game.
